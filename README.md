# Employee-Attendance-Leaves-Analytics-Dashboard
This project showcases a Power BI dashboard created to analyze employee attendance and leaves over a three-month period. The data was sourced from Excel datasets available on the Codebasics website.

The primary visualizations included in the dashboard are area charts, which effectively represent the following metrics:

Employee Presence Percentage: This metric tracks the daily percentage of employees present at work over three months (April, May, and June 2022).
Work-from-Home (WFH) Percentage: This visualization shows the daily percentage of employees working remotely during the same period.
Sick Leave (SL) Percentage: This chart displays the daily percentage of employees on sick leave.

Key Features:
Interactive Area Charts: The area charts provide a clear and interactive view of the fluctuations in attendance, WFH, and SL percentages, making it easy to identify trends and patterns.
Date and Weekday Analysis: The dashboard includes a breakdown of attendance, WFH, and SL percentages by date and by day of the week, offering detailed insights into daily and weekly attendance trends.
Overall Summary: The dashboard features a summary section displaying the overall percentages of presence, WFH, and SL for the entire period, providing a quick overview of employee attendance and leave metrics
